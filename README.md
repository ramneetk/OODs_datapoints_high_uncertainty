This code is for the [paper](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~balaji/udl2021/accepted-papers/UDL2021-paper-081.pdf), "Detecting OODs as datapoints with High Uncertainty", presented at ICML 2021 Workshop on .ncertainty & Robustness in Deep Learning. 

## Requirements
It is tested under Ubuntu Linux 16.04.1 and Python 3.6 environment, and requries Pytorch package to be installed:

1. [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
2. [scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)
